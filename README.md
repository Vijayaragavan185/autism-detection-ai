# AI-Driven Early Detection of Autism in Toddlers

## Project Overview
This project presents a non-invasive AI-based approach for the early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in toddlers using multimodal data analysis, with a focus on visual cues captured through camera systems. Early diagnosis of ASD can significantly improve intervention outcomes, potentially altering developmental trajectories.

## Problem Statement
Traditional ASD screening methods often rely on subjective assessments, leading to delayed diagnoses (typically after age 4). This project aims to develop an AI pipeline that objectively identifies early behavioral markers of autism through video analysis, potentially enabling earlier intervention.

## Solution Architecture

The proposed solution addresses three key aspects of autism detection:

### 1. Eye Contact Analysis
Eye contact abnormalities are one of the earliest and most reliable indicators of ASD. Our system uses computer vision techniques to:
- Track face and eye regions using facial landmark detection
- Estimate gaze direction and focus points
- Analyze temporal patterns of eye contact during social interactions
- Quantify eye contact duration, frequency, and quality

### 2. Repetitive Behavior Detection
Stereotypical motor movements are distinctive behavioral markers for ASD. Our approach:
- Employs human pose estimation to track body keypoints
- Applies temporal pattern recognition to identify repetitive movements
- Focuses on common movements like hand flapping, body rocking, and finger mannerisms
- Calculates frequency, duration, and intensity of repetitive behaviors

### 3. Social Reciprocity Assessment
Difficulties with social engagement are fundamental to ASD diagnosis. Our system:
- Tracks response to name calling through head movement analysis
- Measures joint attention behaviors (following pointing, showing objects)
- Analyzes interaction patterns between child and caregiver
- Quantifies social engagement metrics like response latency and attention sharing

## Technical Implementation

### Data Pipeline
1. Video Input → Preprocessing → Parallel Feature Extraction → Feature Fusion → Classification

### Key Technologies
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, MediaPipe for facial landmark detection and pose estimation
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow/PyTorch implementation of CNN-LSTM architectures for temporal pattern analysis
- **Machine Learning**: Ensemble methods for final classification combining multiple behavioral features

### Model Training & Evaluation
- Dataset requirements include annotated videos of both typically developing children and those with confirmed ASD
- Model evaluation using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score
- Clinical validation through comparison with established diagnostic tools

## Limitations and Ethical Considerations
- The system is designed as a screening tool, not a diagnostic replacement
- Performance may vary based on video quality, lighting, and cultural contexts
- Privacy and data security are paramount when handling sensitive pediatric data
- Careful implementation is needed to avoid bias across different demographics

## Future Directions
- Integration of additional behavioral markers
- Longitudinal analysis capabilities
- Mobile application development for wider accessibility
- Expanded validation across diverse populations
